# Event-based analytics

This project is part of Tripleten's Data Analytics Bootcamp. It is the second integrated project and comprises a sample of the skills acquired throughout the program (Python, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, business analysis, and data explanation).

In this project we have a database with the logs of user activity for an online platform. We want to analyze the behaviour of the custerms through an A/A/B test and determine whether the change made to the platform had an impact in the user conversion rate.

Data cleaning is performed, the relevant period to be analyzed is determined, the funnels of events is studied, and the conversion rates calculated. The differences in conversion rates between groups are commented and statisticaly tested.

The project is done on a Jupyter notebook and has the comments, results, explanations and conclusions of the case.

Thank you very much!
